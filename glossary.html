            <div class="term-title">Extended Detection and Response (XDR)</div>
            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> XDR is an advanced cybersecurity solution that unifies data from multiple sources—endpoints, network, email, and cloud—into a single view. It uses AI-driven analytics to detect, prioritize, and respond to complex threats across the environment.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> By correlating data across all attack surfaces, XDR reduces the time to detect and mitigate threats, helping organizations prevent breaches and minimizing disruptions. This system supports faster incident response, leading to better operational efficiency.

            <div class="term-title">Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</div>
            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> EDR solutions continuously monitor endpoints, such as laptops and servers, to detect suspicious behavior. They offer detailed activity logs and help security teams contain and remediate attacks before they spread.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> EDR helps reduce downtime by rapidly isolating compromised devices and providing automated playbooks for response, ensuring minimal impact on business continuity.

            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Threat intelligence gathers data on emerging cyber threats from multiple sources, providing insights into attacker behavior and evolving tactics. It includes curated feeds and research from security analysts to stay ahead of new attack vectors.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> Trellix’s threat intelligence enables proactive defense by identifying potential risks before they are a threat, giving organizations a competitive edge against attackers.

            <div class="term-title">Incident Response</div>
            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Incident response refers to the process of identifying, managing, and mitigating the impact of cybersecurity events. It involves predefined steps, such as detection, containment, investigation, and recovery.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> With Trellix’s automated response tools, businesses can reduce the time needed to address incidents, ensuring swift recovery and minimizing reputational damage.

            <div class="term-title">Zero Trust</div>
            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Zero Trust is a security framework that requires continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications, whether inside or outside the network perimeter. No entity is trusted by default.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> Implementing Zero Trust improves security posture by minimizing attack surfaces and limiting access to sensitive resources, reducing the chance of insider threats and unauthorized access.

            <div class="term-title">Firewall</div>
            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> Firewalls protect networks by blocking malicious traffic, preventing unauthorized access, and acting as the first line of defense in multi-layered security frameworks.

            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> SIEM platforms aggregate and analyze log data from various sources across an organization’s infrastructure to detect unusual activity and trigger alerts.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> SIEM helps organizations detect complex threats through event correlation, allowing for real-time monitoring and early warning for security teams.

            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers trick individuals into revealing personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, often through deceptive emails or websites.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> With strong phishing detection tools, Trellix helps prevent data breaches by identifying and blocking suspicious communications before they reach users.

            <div class="term-description">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> MFA requires users to authenticate themselves through two or more verification methods, such as passwords, biometrics, or one-time codes.
                <br><strong>Customer Impact:</strong> MFA strengthens security by adding layers of protection, making it harder for unauthorized users to access sensitive systems even if credentials are compromised.
